    <subject>ROS: [Notice] GLOBALFOUNDRIES Reticle Obsolescence Cycle {!Reticle__c.ROS_Cycle__c}</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Customer:

Subject:  Reticle disposition and Product EOL

1. Reticle Disposition
One important element of our customer relationships is the professional and trustworthy handling of
your intellectual property (&quot;IP&quot;).   Attached is a list of the current reticles that we are maintaining for you
as a part of our manufacturing relationship, but which have remained inactive for a year or more, or
may have been superseded by a new revision (henceforth referred to as “Inactive Reticles”).

Please confirm your preferred option for the disposal of the reticles related to your product, namely:

Option A: Obsolete and return Inactive Reticles to you (cost of shipping need to be borne by you).

Option B: Obsolete and scrap Inactive Reticles on your behalf using a vendor of GLOBALFOUNDRIES’s
choice. We can provide evidence of destruction of the scrapped reticles upon request.

Option C: Keep the Inactive Reticles. Reticle storage will be charged to customer at the cost of US$200
for 6 months /reticle for 8&quot; fab &amp; US$300 for 6 months/reticle for 12&quot; fab or GLOBALFOUNDRIES&apos;
prevailing Service Pricing Guidelines, whichever is higher).  Customer has to provide Purchase Order for
these inventory charges.

To help in this process, we ask that you complete and return the attached response to the Customer
Service Representative or Account Manager within 21 calendar days
from the date of this letter.

Option C will be activated by default if we do not hear from you on your choices after 21 calendar days
of this notification.

2. Product EOL

Please note that the device and any device revision which requires the use of the returned or scrapped
Inactive Reticles for manufacturing will be EOL, removed from our product list, and future purchases will
not be accepted.

Your support and cooperation in managing these important aspects of our manufacturing relationship is
greatly appreciated.

Best Regards,
GLOBALFOUNDRIES Customer Support Team</textOnly>
