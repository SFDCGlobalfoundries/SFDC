    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName}

Good news â€“ the Global-FoundryView beta release is ready for release! We will enable your account on 16 Oct 2013.

Global-FoundryView was designed based upon a collaborative engagement between GLOBALFOUNDRIES and our customers and partners. In the coming months, GLOBALFOUNDRIES will be migrating applets from FoundryView to Global-FoundryView. In order to minimize memorization of multiple logins and passwords, users can log onto the Global-FoundryView site and access new and old applets. Our goal will be to finalize the transformation by the first half of 2014. Since the portal is focused on you, our customer, your feedback is appreciated.
