    <textOnly>Dear {!UserLicense.Name},

We have noted that your have not logged into Salesforce.com since **********. We have strict limitation on the license count and in order to avoid additional costs associated with acquiring new licenses, we actively monitor the usage. Our expectation is that users log in once a week via Chatter, Mobile App, or standard SFDC log-in.

We maintain a dashboard {!$Label.Salesforce_Org_URL}01Z900000009gue that identifies users who have not logged in for more than 14 days. If you have not logged in beyond 30 days we will consider your account eligible for inactivation. In order for you to reactivate your account if this occurs, please contact your local Administrator.

US Malta - Albert Frank
US - Vianney Gonzales, Dipty Mahbhate, Lydia (Peichung) Sung
EUR - Michael Verwagner, Charles Derby
APJ - Jasmine Lin, Pei Jen Cheo

In order to avoid future notification, log into SFDC once a week or contact a local administrator if you no longer need your account.

Thank you,

SFDC Admin</textOnly>
