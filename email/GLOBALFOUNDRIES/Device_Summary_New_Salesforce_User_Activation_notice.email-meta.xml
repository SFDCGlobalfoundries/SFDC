 - Loading of 13K devices in salesforce and the associated device team member in Opportunity Program team.

Notes : This release does not impact to the BX-041, PTRF Validation, IP Declaration form and Export Control form which still function as normal in Siebel CRM.

You can approach Kian Ching Ng for more information on device migration.

We have strict limitation on the license count and in order to avoid additional costs associated with acquiring new licenses, we actively monitor the usage. Our expectation is that users log in once a week via Chatter, Mobile App, or standard SFDC log-in.

We maintain a dashboard {!$Label.Salesforce_Org_URL}01Z900000009gue that identifies users who have not logged in for more than 14 days. If you have not logged in beyond 30 days we will consider your account eligible for inactivation. In order for you to reactivate your account if this occurs, please contact your local Administrator.

US Malta - Albert Frank

APJ - Jasmine Lin, Pei Jen Cheo

In order to avoid future notification, log into SFDC once a week or contact a local administrator if you no longer need your account.

Thank you,
